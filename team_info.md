#### Your Solution
Our solution is a service that solves the problem of the unavailability of loans with optimally low interest rates in Nigeria via an API (to be used by loan-granting businesses/societies) which offers prospective investors optimally lucrative interests on their money.
This API has endpoints that enable loan-granting businesses/societies to enable their customers to source for loans. These loans have interests that increase with the promised refund date but never beyond a maximum interest rate set by these businesses/societies.
Also, this API offers endpoints that enable patronizing investors to view prospective loan offers, make their money available for present and future loan offers for a particular duration, and get refunded with a lucrative interest rate.
